# TODOs

Write the total entropy as S_max = S_x_max + S_p_max and find the difference between the distributions to measure S(t).

* For mixing-momenta, just use the expression for delta p_n and integrate out the piston entirely and see if the simulation gives the same thing. you should be able to do this efficiently.
* see if you can find a system this is similar to. is the piston problem dual to another?
